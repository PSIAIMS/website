    "text": "SAS has been a long standing pharmaceutical industry standard for GXP work, so it’s understandable that proposing to change to alternative software, would be met with resistance and trepidation. However, it’s important to ask yourself “Why R?”, why is there a shift by companies to start to use R alongside SAS (or even replacing SAS)? Some key justification are provided below, which could be used to persuade reluctant adopters that there truly is a business case for R adoption (and for open source collaboration in general).\n\nWhy open-source software?\nOpen-source is a positive shift in mindset incorporating the following traits:\n\nAdapt to survive\nUse-and-improve\nChallenge the status quo\nContinuous feedback\nSelf-service learning\nCollaborate\n\n\n\nR ecosystem synergies result in resource efficiencies and cost savings\nR and python ecosystems are ideal for analytic engineering:\n\nModular, build-and-extend model\nFully integrated help documentation with further user-guide capabilities via quarto (markdown)\nStandardised test frameworks\nContinuous arrival of new methods and tools being written\nInteroperability between R python and the wider Data Science ecosystem (multi-language code usage)\nNo purchase costs\n\nCollaboration allows for a larger pool of available talent to achieve more together:\n\nReduces duplication of work being conducted within each company\nEasy re-use of code\nEngineering efficiencies (built in documentation/test frameworks/re-use of code & tools)\n\n\n\nEnhanced graphics & reporting capabilities\nThe following are just a few of the Enhanced graphics & reporting capabilities offered when using open-source software\n\nBrilliant graphics and interactive graphics\nInteractive story-telling capabilities through Shiny\nDynamic/automated reporting through quarto (rmarkdown)\nMetadata efficiencies\nSupports advanced analytics\n\n\n\nLarger community support\n\nR community user support is larger than any purchased software company could provide\nA wealth of information, help and advice available for free online\n\n\n\nIndustry trend\nSubstantial work ongoing to support the use of R within pharma. This is highlighted by the number of cross industry working groups addressing each of the areas of previous concern\n\npharmaverse\nR Submissions working group\nRTRS working group\nR Validation Hub\nCAMIS\n\n\n\nTalent attraction and retention\nThe pharmaceutical industry has always struggled to bring in enough experienced SAS programmers and statisticians. Open source languages and tools will lead to a bigger pool of available talent to work in the pharmaceutical industry. New starters (Uni leavers) will know R and data science tools already. Talent from other academic and industry fields may want to transition into pharma increasing our talent pool. Learning from each other enables the industry to move adapt quicker and embrace new technilogy quicker which leads to more efficiencies and cost savings\n\n\nIncreased opportunities for cross-pharma standardization/Reduced burden for individual companies\nCurrently each company writes their own specific processes, SAS macros and tools. This time is “Non-billable time”, at a cost to the company. pharmaverse are providing open source industry wide standard macros for SDTM, ADaM, TFLs and tools. Moving to open source languages and tools would have the following benefits:\n\nReduced cost, burden and duplication of effort for individual companies - increased efficiencies\nPackage/macro support and documentation thorough and complete\nTransferable knowledge when people move companies as staff are familiar with open source macros and do not have to re-learn individual company macros and tools\nStandardized SDTM, AdAM & TFLs means less project specific bespoke programming for common analyses / endpoints\nFrom limited static approach per company to multiple innovative collaborative approaches\nModular building of packages/macros enables quick adoption of new more efficient methods"

    "text": "R Introduction\nWhat is R? – [R: The R Project for Statistical Computing](https://www.r-project.org/)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR is a powerful programming language and environment specifically designed for statistical computing and graphics. Born in the halls of academia in 1993, it has evolved into an essential tool in the statistical world, especially for clinical research. Think of R as your statistical workshop where:\n\nYou can perform sophisticated statistical analyses, from traditional hypothesis testing to cutting-edge adaptive designs\nCreate publication-quality graphics with precise control over every visual element\nHandle data of any size or structure with elegant efficiency\nAutomate repetitive tasks with custom functions\nShare and collaborate through reproducible code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat makes R special is its modular framework and extensibility—it’s like having a basic toolkit that you can continuously enhance with specialized instruments. This is particularly valuable in clinical research, where methodological requirements can be highly specific and evolve quickly. Did You Know? 📝 R was named after its creators’ first initials (Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman) and as a playful reference to the S programming language it superseded.\n\n\nCRAN – the Comprehensive R Archive Network - [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/)\nYour one-stop package shop!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCRAN is the treasure trove of over 22,000 packages that extend R’s capabilities in a multitude of ways – statistical, graphical, AI, computational.\n\nWant to analyze time-to-event data? There are packages for that\nLooking to design adaptive clinical trials? Covered\nLooking to build machine learning models? Take your pick\n\n\n\nPackages and Dependencies\nR packages are like LEGO blocks—they snap together to build something amazing. Here’s what you need to know:\n\nPackages are collections of R functions, data, and code\nDependencies are packages that need to be installed for your package to work\nInstallation can be as simple as: install.packages(“package_name”) and dependencies will install automatically\n\n\n\nOther Open-Source Languages\nWhile R excels in statistical computing and is the main open-source language currently being used in the industry, there are others:\n\nPython: Used extensively for machine learning, artificial intelligence, and deep learning applications. Popular for mathematics courses, processing real-world evidence data, natural language processing of medical texts, and developing prediction models for patient outcomes.\nJulia: A high-performance language specifically designed for numerical and scientific computing. Gaining traction in clinical trial simulations and complex mathematical modeling due to its exceptional speed, particularly useful for large-scale clinical trial simulations and pharmacometric analyses.\nJavaScript: Powers interactive applications and dashboards for clinical trial data visualization. Essential for creating dynamic, web-based reporting tools and interactive safety monitoring displays. Often used with R Shiny applications to enhance user interfaces.\nHTML: The foundation for web-based tasks. Essential for creating structured, accessible documentation that can be easily shared across organizations.\n\n\n\nIntegrated Development Environments (IDEs)\nAn Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is like a sophisticated text editor specifically designed for writing code. Instead of just typing R commands into a basic console, an IDE provides a complete workspace with helpful features like syntax highlighting (coloring your code for readability), error checking, code completion, and integrated help. Think of it as the difference between writing in a basic notepad versus using a modern word processor with spell check, formatting, and other helpful tools. The right IDE can significantly improve your coding efficiency and help maintain good programming practices. It brings together all the tools you need - code editor, R console, file management, and visualization tools - into one organized interface.\n\n\nRStudio\nRStudio is the most widely used IDE for R programming in the pharmaceutical industry.\n\n\nRStudio Desktop\nThe free version of RStudio provides all essential features: - Code editor with syntax highlighting - R console for immediate output - Environment pane showing your data and objects - Output panes for plots, files, packages, and help - Project management capabilities - Built-in Git integration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosit Workbench\nThe paid, enterprise version of RStudio is tailored for collaboration and scalability:\nKey Benefits: - Centralized & Secure: Everyone works in the same validated environment through a web browser, rather than having R Studio installed on individual computers - Collaboration: Multiple team members can work on the same projects and share code easily - Control: IT departments can manage: - Who has access to what - Which R versions and packages are available - Where data and code are stored - How resources (memory, CPU) are allocated\n\n\nAlternative IDEs\nOther IDEs are available and may be useful depending on your needs. Here are some examples:\n\nVisual Studio Code\nModern interface\nSupports multiple programming languages\nStrong debugging tools\nJupyter Notebook\nDocument-style analysis\nCombines code and documentation\nPopular for sharing analytical work\nPosit Positron\nNew desktop IDE from Posit\nModern, lightweight alternative to RStudio Desktop\nBuilt on VS Code technology\nSupports both R and Python\nCurrently in early adoption phase\n\n\n\nPopular Packages\nSo you have R in the R Studio IDE, let’s introduce some essential packages to start your journey. ## Base R: Your Foundation Base R comes pre-installed with your R installation and includes fundamental tools for: - Data structures (vectors, matrices, data frames) - Basic statistical functions (mean, median, linear regression) - Simple plotting capabilities - File input/output operations See this helpful cheat sheet for basic commands – https://iqss.github.io/dss-workshops/R/Rintro/base-r-cheat-sheet.pdf R comes with many built-in packages. Some are loaded automatically when you start R (like stats and graphics), while others are installed but need to be loaded with library() when you need them (like survival or MASS). While Base R is powerful, modern R programming often relies on additional packages that make coding more intuitive and efficient. This firstly leads us on to the tidyverse.\n\n\nTidyverse: Modern Data Science Tools – [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tidyverse is a collection of packages designed to work together harmoniously for standard dataset tasks. Core packages include: - dplyr: Data manipulation (filter, sort, summarize) - ggplot2: Creating professional graphics - tidyr: Data cleaning and reshaping - haven: SAS data import - tibble: Modern data frames Example of tidyverse syntax:\n# Base R approach\nsubset(data, Age &gt; 18)[, c(\"PatientID\", \"Treatment\")]\n\n# Tidyverse approach\ndata %&gt;% \n  filter(Age &gt; 18) %&gt;% \n  select(PatientID, Treatment)\n\n\nPharmaverse: Industry-Specific Tools – [Pharmaverse](https://pharmaverse.org/)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pharmaverse is a collection of packages specifically designed for clinical trial workflows. Here are some examples: - admiral: ADaM dataset creation following CDISC standards - ggsurvfit: Publication-ready survival plots and time-to-event analyses - riskmetric: Risk assessment and validation of R packages - logrx: Standardized logging for clinical trial analysis These packages work together to support regulatory-compliant clinical trial analysis workflows while maintaining reproducibility and traceability. Getting Started Tip: Most pharmaverse packages build on tidyverse principles, so becoming comfortable with tidyverse first will make learning industry-specific packages easier.\n\n\nQuick Start: Your First 5 Minutes with R\nLet’s walk through a complete example from installation to visualization. We’ll analyse some survival data using just the essentials:\n# 1. Install and load just what we need\ninstall.packages(c(\"dplyr\", \"ggplot2\", \"survival\"))  # Only needed once\nlibrary(dplyr)              \nlibrary(ggplot2)            \nlibrary(survival)           \n\n# 2. Get some example data (built into survival package)\n?lung                       # Information on survival data from a cancer study\nhead(lung)                  # Quick look at first few rows\n\n# 3. Simple analysis: Calculate median survival time by sex\nlung_analysis &lt;- lung %&gt;%\n  mutate(sex = factor(sex, labels = c(\"Male\", \"Female\"))) %&gt;%\n  group_by(sex) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    n = n(),\n    median_time = median(time, na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n\n# 4. Create a simple survival plot\nggplot(lung, aes(x = time, y = status, color = factor(sex))) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +\n  labs( title = \"Survival Status by Time\", x = \"Time (days)\", y = \"Status\" )\n\n\nQuick Start Tips:\n\n✅ Start RStudio\n✅ Copy this code into a new script\n✅ Run each section using Ctrl+Enter (Cmd+Enter on Mac)\n✅ Save your script (File &gt; Save As…) Common First-Time Issues:\n❌ Make sure to run library() after installation\n❌ Watch for typos - R is case-sensitive That’s it! You’ve just completed your first R analysis. From here, you can explore more packages as needed.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading and Links\n\nFurther Reading: “R for Data Science” by Hadley Wickham & Garrett Grolemund\nEssential guide for modern R programming\nFree online: [R for Data Science eBook](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/)\nLinks:\n[R: The R Project for Statistical Computing](https://www.r-project.org/)\n[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/)\n[RStudio Desktop Download](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)\n[Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/)\n[Pharmaverse](https://pharmaverse.org/)"

The CAMIS repository went live in January 2023, drawing on the content from the PHUSE CSRMLW project. This searchable repo compares analysis method implementations in software (CAMIS) such as SAS, R and python.\nThe White Paper was published in June, which highlighted the importance of clearly specifying your analysis, such that it can be replicated in different software, and isn’t relying on default options which can be different. For more complex analyses, it can still be hard to understand what defaults and algorithms your software is using, so the team focused 2023 on expanding our repo content, comparing SAS vs R methods. By August, we had covered the following topics in the repo: quartiles, rounding, anova, mmrm, cmh, log-rank, cox-ph, mcnemar’s test, kruskal-wallis test and logistic. October saw the launch of the sub-working group: CAMIS-Oncology, led by Somasekhar Sriadibhatla (AstraZeneca). This team will focus specifically on oncology endpoints and analyzing them in SAS, R and Python. The CAMIS team have expanded in membership during 2023 presenting at numerous conferences around the world. In November, we welcomed Harshal Khanolkar (NovoNordisk), to join the leadership team alongside Christina Fillmore (GSK) and Lyn Taylor (PAREXEL). Our focus for 2024, will be on the creation of additional content for the repo, and sharing awareness of the project across the medical research and wider community. We’d like to take this opportunity to thank all of our team members and contributors, and encourage everyone to check out the repository and help us to grow our content CAMIS (psiaims.github.io). If you would like to join the team please get in touch through the repo."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This was a very successful event where 70+ people attended to discuss change management issues in Open-Source including training, organisational change and managing during times of big changes, communicating to colleagues and managers, timing and resourcing change. The audience were split across Pharma (46%), CRO (41%), Biotech (4%) and other affiliations including academia. The audience were pretty evenly split between those that used R and open-source tools regularly (49%) and those that used it infrequently or not at all (51%). Our 9 speakers presented on many topics, covering managing change at larger pharma companies where they have already made the move to open-source tools, but also presenting the view from CROs where use of open-source tools is growing but not yet established. Training, support and preparedness for change was a common theme in presentations – being ready for the journey and whatever happens along the way.\nThe audience were very engaged and asked interesting questions many of which we covered as part of a panel discussion. Common themes in questions included resourcing for change when the day job doesn’t allow much additional time and resource to do so; how AI might help with changing from one software and programming language to another; addressing management and IT organisation questions about moving to new systems and the return on investment. At the end of the day, delegates were invited to reflect and think about next steps in group discussion – what is the next action to take within their organisation, what are the “quick wins” or proofs of concept that might convince others within their organistion, and how to “unlock” acceptance of open-source.\nFeedback from delegates was very positive and we will aim to provide some resources for delegates and those that did not attend – the first of which, the presentations from the day, can be found below. PSI AIMS and PhUSE Open Source Technologies for Clinical Data Analysis (OSTCDA) working groups will benefit from this event enormously, having a better understanding of industry needs and looking to provide more support and material in this area. As there also seemed to be support for a follow-on meeting, the obvious next steps for the groups would be to organise more events which could be online or in person.\n\nMike Smith - Pfizer - Change Management\nAndy Nicholls - GSK - From Training to Practice: A shift to Just in Time User Support\nMartin Brown - PPD - Change Management in a Large CRO; Investing for the Future\nKieran Martin - Roche - Getting Ready for submission with R\nStuart Malcolm - Veramed - Planning on R? \u000bRisk, Resources and Realism\nYannick Vandendijck - Johnson & Johnson - SAIL.R – Journey Towards R Software for Statisticians in Johnson & Johnson\nRuhul Amin - AZ - R in Biometrics - AstraZeneca approach to enable R Shiny apps for Drug Project activities\nSebastia Barcelo - Cytel - Navigating Change in a CRO – What I Wish I Knew 5 Years Ago About Transitioning to R\nColin Gillespie - Jumping Rivers - Can I trust this package?"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nIn a pharmaceutical industry that is rapidly changing and evolving, there can be many reactions to open-source, from worry and fear on the one side, to over-excitement and ‘jumping on the band-wagon’ on the other. The aim of this blog post and others throughout the year from the PSI AIMS SIG is to show that open-source skills are important. They can increase your work efficiencies and enhance your career, whatever type of statistician or data scientist you are! Therefore, we will be presenting a range of essential skills and foundational concepts in a clear and accessible manner through these blog posts.\n\n\nWhat do open-source skills bring?\nOpen-source is a positive shift in mindset challenging the status quo incorporating the following traits:\n\nFaster innovation\nIncreased efficiency\nModular, build-and-extend models\nBetter collaboration\nStandardised test frameworks\nContinuous arrival of new methods and tools being written\n\nBut this does not mean that every statistician needs to become a software engineer! A natural misconception with a new coding language, is that you need to become a deep expert of all its aspects, to use it effectively. In fact, the big positive of open-source is that many different types of people can use it effectively, in small and large ways, effectively leaning on each other - “Standing on the shoulders of giants”!. The following Venn diagram picks out 3 main ‘statistician’ types:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere do I begin?!\nWhatever type of statistician you are, you can benefit from understanding the basics of various skills, concepts and terms. As everything is moving forward quickly and there is an abundance of ‘google’ knowledge, it is hard to know where to start. We want to help you, through provision of these blogs!\n\n\nIntroducing Open Source Skills\nOver this series of blog posts, we will look at and introduce you to some key areas:\n\nOpen source landscape basics (R version, IDEs, package versions, terms, different setups, lots can change)\nHow do I find / review packages?\nPopular open-source stats resources (CAMIS, Pharmaverse, AIMS, Openstatsware etc.)\nGood coding practices (style guides)\nCollaborating with people on packages (CRAN email, GitHub intro)\nHow to file a GitHub issue\nHow to carry out a GitHub pull request\nContainers introduction\nParallelization – what is the minimum amount I need to understand about the system to be successful?\n\n\n\nConclusion\nOpen-source skills are a crucial asset in the pharmaceutical industry, offering a wealth of opportunities to enhance your work day and career. Regardless of your role—whether you’re a project statistician, statistical data scientist, or methodologist—embracing open-source software can lead to faster innovation, better collaboration, and a continuous influx of new methods and tools. Stay tuned for our upcoming blog posts, where we’ll dive deeper into the open-source landscape basics, share practical tips for finding and using packages, and guide you through essential coding practices.
