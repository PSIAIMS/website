    "text": "SAS has been a long standing pharmaceutical industry standard for GXP work, so it’s understandable that proposing to change to alternative software, would be met with resistance and trepidation. However, it’s important to ask yourself “Why R?”, why is there a shift by companies to start to use R alongside SAS (or even replacing SAS)? Some key justification are provided below, which could be used to persuade reluctant adopters that there truly is a business case for R adoption (and for open source collaboration in general).\n\n\n\n\nparam filename Name of RMarkdown or Markdown document\nparam toc_header_name The table of contents header name. If specified, any\nheader with this format will not be included in the TOC. Set to NULL to\ninclude the TOC itself in the TOC (but why?).\nparam base_level Starting level of the lowest header level. Any headers\nprior to the first header at the base_level are dropped silently.\nparam toc_depth Maximum depth for TOC, relative to base_level. Default is\n[toc_depth = 3, which results in a TOC of at most 3 levels.](#toc_depth-=-3,-which-results-in-a-toc-of-at-most-3-levels.)\nWhy open-source software?\nR ecosystem synergies result in resource efficiencies and cost savings\nEnhanced graphics & reporting capabilities\nLarger community support\nIndustry trend\nTalent attraction and retention\nIncreased opportunities for cross-pharma standardization/Reduced burden for individual companies\n\n\n\n\nWhy open-source software?\nOpen-source is a positive shift in mindset incorporating the following traits:\n\nAdapt to survive\nUse-and-improve\nChallenge the status quo\nContinuous feedback\nSelf-service learning\nCollaborate\n\n\n\nR ecosystem synergies result in resource efficiencies and cost savings\nR and python ecosystems are ideal for analytic engineering:\n\nModular, build-and-extend model\nFully integrated help documentation with further user-guide capabilities via quarto (markdown)\nStandardised test frameworks\nContinuous arrival of new methods and tools being written\nInteroperability between R python and the wider Data Science ecosystem (multi-language code usage)\nNo purchase costs\n\nCollaboration allows for a larger pool of available talent to achieve more together:\n\nReduces duplication of work being conducted within each company\nEasy re-use of code\nEngineering efficiencies (built in documentation/test frameworks/re-use of code & tools)\n\n\n\nEnhanced graphics & reporting capabilities\nThe following are just a few of the Enhanced graphics & reporting capabilities offered when using open-source software\n\nBrilliant graphics and interactive graphics\nInteractive story-telling capabilities through Shiny\nDynamic/automated reporting through quarto (rmarkdown)\nMetadata efficiencies\nSupports advanced analytics\n\n\n\nLarger community support\n\nR community user support is larger than any purchased software company could provide\nA wealth of information, help and advice available for free online\n\n\n\nIndustry trend\nSubstantial work ongoing to support the use of R within pharma. This is highlighted by the number of cross industry working groups addressing each of the areas of previous concern\n\npharmaverse\nR Submissions working group\nRTRS working group\nR Validation Hub\nCAMIS\n\n\n\nTalent attraction and retention\nThe pharmaceutical industry has always struggled to bring in enough experienced SAS programmers and statisticians. Open source languages and tools will lead to a bigger pool of available talent to work in the pharmaceutical industry. New starters (Uni leavers) will know R and data science tools already. Talent from other academic and industry fields may want to transition into pharma increasing our talent pool. Learning from each other enables the industry to move adapt quicker and embrace new technilogy quicker which leads to more efficiencies and cost savings\n\n\nIncreased opportunities for cross-pharma standardization/Reduced burden for individual companies\nCurrently each company writes their own specific processes, SAS macros and tools. This time is “Non-billable time”, at a cost to the company. pharmaverse are providing open source industry wide standard macros for SDTM, ADaM, TFLs and tools. Moving to open source languages and tools would have the following benefits:\n\nReduced cost, burden and duplication of effort for individual companies - increased efficiencies\nPackage/macro support and documentation thorough and complete\nTransferable knowledge when people move companies as staff are familiar with open source macros and do not have to re-learn individual company macros and tools\nStandardized SDTM, AdAM & TFLs means less project specific bespoke programming for common analyses / endpoints\nFrom limited static approach per company to multiple innovative collaborative approaches\nModular building of packages/macros enables quick adoption of new more efficient methods"
